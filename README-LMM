I put the data in /frontend/static/data/
in agent.py, I set the doc_path to DOC_PATH = "./frontend/static/data/"
in agent.py I create my variant of the report_source
in multi_agents/agents I create my variant of the agent lmm_cv.py

when the user clicks the frontend create a task in the web socket
the websocket manager creates an agent and a researcher
the researcher runs the research and sends the results to the LLM agent
the LLM agent creates a report and sends it to the user

I use the gpt_researcher/master/agent.py as the base agent

I use the reviser as the base for the agents

pending , copy output as json of reviser
