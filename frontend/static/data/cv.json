    "Designed and implemented an AI video surveillance system for peacekeeping missions. NVIDIA Jetson, YOLO, DeepStream, NVIDIA TRITON, Azure Video Analyzer, AZURE STACK EDGE, Kubernetes. One of the most complex technology implementation projects I led was the development and deployment of an AI-driven video surveillance system for UN peacekeeping missions while at UNOPS. The system was designed to enhance security in conflict zones by providing real-time threat detection and analysis using advanced video analytics.\nThe key challenges included working with limited infrastructure in remote and high-risk environments and ensuring the system's robustness under these conditions. To address these challenges, I worked closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, field operators, and security personnel. We implemented Azure Stack Edge and Kubernetes for on-site processing, enabling real-time analytics even with limited connectivity.\nAnother major challenge was coordinating with multiple stakeholders, including UN security teams and local personnel. To ensure successful delivery, I applied Agile methodology, conducting iterative testing and regular updates to maintain flexibility and adaptability in this dynamic environment. I also led detailed risk assessments and mitigation strategies to ensure system stability and security compliance.\nThrough a combination of strong project management, collaboration, and continuous feedback loops, the project was delivered on time and significantly improved situational awareness and response times in the field.",
    
    "Designed and implemented a system for detecting hate speech in social media, contributing to global UN efforts. One of the most challenging projects I led was the development and implementation of a hate speech detection system for social media as part of a UN initiative at UNOPS. The project aimed to detect and flag harmful content in real-time, contributing to the global effort against hate speech.\nA key challenge was ensuring the system’s accuracy across multiple languages and diverse contexts, as hate speech can be subtle and vary significantly across regions. To address this, I worked closely with a team of data scientists and linguists to refine the natural language processing (NLP) models and improve the system's detection capabilities. We incorporated machine learning techniques to continuously enhance accuracy based on feedback loops.\nAnother challenge was the scale of the data, as the system had to process vast amounts of real-time social media content. To manage this, we implemented Azure Cloud and Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and efficient data processing.\nStakeholder management was also critical, given the involvement of various UN entities and external partners. By using Agile methodology, I ensured iterative development and constant communication, allowing for regular feedback and adjustments. The project was successfully delivered, improving the detection of hate speech across multiple platforms and supporting UN efforts globally.",

    "One of the most complex technology implementation projects I led was during my time at UNOPS, where I managed the development and deployment of a real-time asset tracking system for peacekeeping missions. The project involved integrating multiple technologies and coordinating across global teams in high-risk environments. The key challenge was ensuring that the system was both secure and reliable in conflict zones with limited infrastructure.\nOne significant challenge was dealing with the complexities of integrating various systems, such as geolocation services, cloud platforms, and on-site hardware, while maintaining real-time data accuracy. To address this, I worked closely with cross-functional teams, including developers and field operators, to ensure proper testing and validation at each stage of implementation. We used Agile methodology to remain flexible and quickly resolve issues as they arose, particularly around network connectivity and data syncing in remote areas.\nAnother challenge was managing stakeholder expectations across different departments. To mitigate this, I facilitated regular meetings to ensure alignment and used detailed project documentation to keep all parties informed. The project was delivered successfully, improving operational efficiency and safety in the field."
